  <h1 class="display-4">Hello, world!</h1>
  <p class="lead">We are the data dudes, and this is Salutaris.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 3vh;"> The purpose of Salutaris is to enable users to have access to different services provided by institutions and organizations in order create an ecosystem where each of us have the right information to improve our health. Along with all the other institutions and organizations that will be interested in providing the health services that we really need, we seek to gameify the health care experience and provide incentives for the user to live a mindful life through exclusive corporate partnerships.

As a user of the Salutaris, according to your submitted survey answers you will receive information related to medical services: cheaper access to medical centers, pharmacy hubs to find specific medicines at lower prices and discounts, as well as nutritional information according with your habits and medical diagnostics. Each interaction with those organizations would be transparent and secure, keeping the userâ€™s privacy secure.

The information generated at the Salutaris in the aggregated mode (e.g. the population grouped by zip codes), could be used by organizations for strategic planning and placing of locales like supermarkets, shopping malls, government institutions services (e.g. counties that aim to improve health services in their area), and other commercial ventures like, pharmacies, laboratories, gyms or restaurants, in order to focus on the need of the population of each area,  generating discounts, gift cards and promotions for our users.

In the future we have plans to give some specialized consulting services (lower cost) with the possibility to integrate telemedicine (general practitioners) with their electronic health records.
